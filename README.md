# LowercaseStringToUppercase
A program that reads a lowercase string of any length and prints its equivalent in uppercase for each letter.
The script will keep characters that are not lowercase letters as they are, it will also maintain spaces.
There are three scripts, one with the "for" command to examine the string to the end and two with the "while" and "do while" commands.
